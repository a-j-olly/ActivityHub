# Reflections

- Brainstorm more with GPT4. Think holistically about the architecture and define the techstack
- Be more prescriptive with technologies in the specification. Define data structures, api routes, authentication workflow, etc.
- Define the design system for the FE.
- Try using TTD in the prompt plan.
- Explicitly request unit tests for each stage (if applicable).
- Try a "deep thinking" model for the development phase.
- Do not provide the todo list to the model. This may hamper the model's ability to use its initiative when approaching problems
